# From Conda to Packages  
### Notes of a Python Learner 📘

This book documents my personal journey learning Python — 
from setting up environments with conda, to working with NumPy & Pandas,
visualizing data, profiling performance, writing scripts, and finally building packages.

My goal is to understand Python deeply, one step at a time — 
and share everything I learn along the way.
